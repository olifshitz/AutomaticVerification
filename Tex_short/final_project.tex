%{Symbolic LTL Model checking}

\section{Abstract}

   In this project, we implement a symbolic LTL model checker, using the reduction to the fair-CTL verification
   problem. We compare between the CTL model checker and the LTL model checker and show that the LTL behaves
   exponentialy in the size of the model. We also extend the original tableau definition to test the impact
   on simple formulas that use the Global and Eventually quatifiers.

\section{Introduction}
   Throughout the course we studied LTL and CTL model checking and algorithms
   used to solve this problem. Though we thoroughly learned the theoretical 
   approach to the model checking problem and the algorithms used to solve them, we did not
   go into detail regarding the verifcation tools available to solve these problems.
   One verifcation tool that we came across during the course was the SMV model
   checker and its expansion to LTL formulae found in \cite{ltl}. Although the
   SMV model checker is a very useful tool for model checking, it is written
   in a pseudo-code language that is not very common to most programmer.
   
   In our project we created a new model checker in $python$ that allows
   verifcation of both temporal logics LTL and CTL. The model checker we
   implemented is symbolic in order to be efficient and uses the algorithms
   shown in class for model checking. Our intention was to create a model
   checker that is both efficeint and easy to use and expand. We have developed
   the relevant modules to simply translate a logical model $M$ into a symbolic
   representation and use this symbolic representation in order validate
   LTL and CTL formulae.
   We tested our model checker on the snooping cache coherence protocol as
   found in \cite{cache}. 
   
   In this paper we describe the relevant algorithms and theory needed to
   understand the implemenation of our model checker. We also describe the 
   main modules of the model checker and the results it achieved on the 
   cache coherence model.

   The entire implementation of this project can be found at \url{https://github.com/olifshitz/AutomaticVerification.git}

\section{CTL and LTL Model Checking}

   Definition of CTL* logic syntax and the subclasses of LTL and CTL can be found in the class notes and \cite{ltl}


    \subsection{Symbolic CTL Model Checking}
        The entire implementation of our project is based on the usage of reduced, ordered 
        binary decision diagrams (ROBDDs). BDDs are a canonical form representation of
        boolean formulas\cite{bdd}.

    \subsection{LTL Model Checking Using Tableaus}
        The theoretical definition and explanation of LTL model checking using tableaus is found at the class notes and \cite{ltl}

\section{Implementation}
    In our project we implemented a symbolic CTL and LTL model cheker in python 
    using python. Throughout our entire implementation we used the python module
    \textbf{pyeda} which allows easy use of BDDs, as explained in the previous section.
    In the following sections we present the main modules in our implemenation and how
    they are used to create the model checker.

    \subsection{Logical model parsing}
        The first module we implemented is the \textbf{SymbolicModel} class; 
        a python class used in order to represent a the symbolic version of 
        a given logical model.
        The class' conststructor receives an integer specifying the number of
        states in the model, and uses that in order to create the variables 
        $v_1, \dots, v_n$ representing the states in the states. It also
        has two interface methods, $add\_atomic$, $add\_relation$ used to
        specify the atomic propositions that hold in each state and the
        transition relation between the states in the model. As explained in
        the previous sections, both the labeling and the transition relation
        of the model are also given as BDDs.
        The SymbolicModel is used to represent the model that we wish to check,
        and thus this class is used throught the entire project.

    \subsection{Tableau construction}
        The next module we implemented is a module in charge of creating the
        tableau for a given LTL formual. In order to create this module we began
        by implementing a formula parser in charge of parsing the given formula 
        for later uses such as parsing the elementary formulae for the tableau or iterating
        over subformulae.

        The next step of implementing the tableau was to create a list of all
        elementary formulae. This was done using the \textbf{get\_elementary\_formulas}
        method we implemented. This method uses the aforementioned formula parser 
        in order to iterate over all parts of the formula and for each quantifier
        found in the formula it creates the relevant elementary formulae.
        For each of the elementary formulae we create a BDD variable that will
        late be used to indicate whether this elementary formula is satisfied.

        The next part of creating the tableau is to find its initial states. As
        explained in the previous section, the initial states of the tableau are
        all states that satisfy the given formula. In order to find these states,
        we implemented the \textbf{sat} module. This module implements the method
        \textbf{get\_sat(formula, el\_bbds)} (where el\_bdds is the set of BDDs
        explained above) and returns a new BDD using logical operands on the
        received BDDs according to the construction of the given formula.

        The elementary BDDs and the \textbf{sat} module described above are then
        used in order to create the transition relation of the tableau itself.
        Again, in order to make this a symbolic model checker and not explicitly
        describe all of the states and transitions, the transition relation is
        also given as a BDD. The fairness constraints of the tableau are also 
        given as a BDD and constructed in a similar manner to the statisfaction
        BDD.

        All the methods described above are encapsulated inside a \textbf{Tableau}
        class object that we created. This object receives the formula and its
        atomic propositions as parameters for the constructor and uses all the
        methods and modules described above in order to create the tableau.

    \subsection{Product structure construction}
        Using the tableau construction above we now implemented the product of
        the tableau and the given logical model. We implemented this as a 
        method of the tableau class described above. This method receives as
        input the symbolic model described earlier and using its relations,
        atomic propositions and the relations and states of the tableau creates
        the product model.

        The use of BDDs makes this operation very simple, as we can see in the
        implemenation presented below.

        \begin{algorithm}[H]
            \caption{Product model creation}\label{product}
            \Procedure{product}{self,model}
                \State \textbf{assert} isinstance(model, SymbolicModel)
                \State product\_relations = model.relations \& self.relations 
                    \quad\quad\& model.atomic \& model.atomic.compose(global\_compose)
                \State \textbf{return} Graph(global\_compose, product\_relations)
            \EndProcedure
        \end{algorithm}

        The use of global\_compose is in order to create a new set of variables
        used for the product model. The Graph object used in the code above is
        a data structure we created in order to create a symbolic representation
        of the product including both its vertices and the edges between them
        based on the relation BDD.

    \subsection{Finding maximal SCCs}
        As taught in class, in order to assert that there is a fair path in the 
        product structure, we need to find a strongly connected component (SCC)
        that is reachable from the initial state and that intersects with
        each one of the fairness constraints.

        In out project we used a symbolic algorithm for finding SCCs in a graph, taken from
        \cite{scc}. A detailed explanation of this algorithm can be found at that article.
        
    \subsection{Finding fair paths}
        As explained in the previous section, in order to check the model, we
        need to assert that there is a fair path in the product. In order to do 
        so, we need to check that each of the fairness constraints is satisfied
        in one of the strongly connected components we found earlier.
        This will tell us if there is a fair SCC in the graph. If no such SCC 
        exists, we can conclude that no fair path exists in the graph. Otherwise,
        we continue to check that this SCC is reachable from one of the initial
        states in the graph.
        
        The logic described above is implemented in the module 
        \textbf{FairPathFinder}. We use the method \textbf{find\_fair\_path}
        that returns a python generator with possible initial states from
        which there exist fair paths.

    \subsection{CTL model checking}
        In order to implement CTL model checking we implemented the CTL model
        checking algorithms shown in class when solving the find the set
        of nodes satisfying the temporal quantifiers $EX$, $EG$ and $EU$.

        When implementing these algorithm we used many of the methods already
        described in the previous section; mostly the modules that are relevant
        to reachability analysis. For example, when solving $EX$ we used the
        successor method described earlier in order to find all the successor
        of a given node.

\section{Extending the Tableau defintion}
    The definition of the Tableau construction is based on the assumption the only temporal quantifiers
    used in the formula where $X$ and $U$. That makes the definition simpler, but actual implementing this
    construction with those restrictions could actually effect the computation process.

    In our project we extended the definition and construction of the Tableau to handle formulas with the
    $F$ and $G$ quantifiers. Using the equivalences $Fa \equiv true\ U\ a$ and $Ga \equiv \lnot F \lnot a$
    we can obtain the new construction steps needed to extend the tableau without hurting the correctness
    of the model.

    At the first step, we add the new elementrary formulas of the form $XFa$ and $XGa$ and define:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item $el(Fa) = \left\{XFa\right\} \cup el(a)$
        \item $el(Ga) = \left\{XGa\right\} \cup el(a)$
    \end{itemize}

    Using the equivalences above we extend the $sat$ definition and the fairness constriant set. the tableau realtion table definition
    stays without change (but now we need to consider the new elementrary formulas):

    \begin{itemize}
        \item $sat(F a) = sat(true U a) = sat(a) \cup (sat(true) \cap sat(X(true U a))) = sat(a) \cup sat(XFa)$
        \item $sat(G a) = sat(\lnot F \lnot a) = \overline{sat(F \lnot a)} = \overline{sat(\lnot a) \cup sat(XF\lnot a)} =
        \overline{sat(\lnot a)} \cap \overline{sat(XF\lnot a)} = sat(a) \cap sat(\lnot XF\lnot a) = sat(a) \cap sat(X\lnotF\lnot a) = sat(a) \cap sat(XGa)$
    \end{itemize}

    Two more classes of fairness contrainsts now add to the fairness constraint set:
    For every subformula $Fg$, we add the fairness constraint
    \[
        \left\{sat(\neg(gUh)\vee h) \;|\; gUh\ in\ f \right\}
    \]

    \[
        \left\{sat((Ga)\vee a) \;|\; Ga\ in\ f \right\}
    \]

    \[        
        \left\{sat(\neg(Fa)\vee a) \;|\; Fa\ in\ f \right\}
    \]


\section{Experiments and Results}
    \subsection{Read-Write Resource Agreement}
        We tested our model checker on a read-write resource management model with multiple processors.
        Each processor is in in one of the next states at each time: $Owned$ for when it can write to the
        resource, $Shared$ for when it can only read from the resource, and $Invalid$ for when the resource
        is not accessible for it. A processor can also be $waiting$, $snooping$ or none of those.

        The protocol we test assume all processors can send messages to each other processor, only one
        processor can send a message each time, and all processor get the messages in the order they were sent.
        Another way to look at this model is that each "turn" there is a single processor marked as $master$ 
        and it will be the one sends the message on that turn. The master is switched arbitrarily each turn.

        There are four types of commands used in this model, each is actually a state-transition reason:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item
                $read-shared$ - sent when a processor wants to escalate to get to the shared tate
            \item
                $read-owned$ - sent when a processor wants to escalate to get to the owned tate
            \item
                $response$ - sent when a processor has comitted is changes and is ready to forfeit
                their owned privileges.
            \item 
                $idle$ - send when the master processor want to stall
        \end{itemize}

        Each processor can be described with two Kripke models, one for the turns it 
        is the master and the command is sent by itself, and one for the turns where another 
        processor is the master, and the command was recevied by the processor.
        Each of those models has 8 states: $shared$, $shared-waiting$, $shared-snooping$,
        $invalid$, $invalid-snooping$, $owned$, $owned-waiting$, and a $sink$ states, that indicates something 
        unexpected has hppened.

            \end{tikzpicture}
            \caption{State transition for non-master processor (receive a message)} \label{fig:ProcModelNotMaster}
            \end{figure}

        The model for master states (send the message) is described in figure 1. The model 
        for non-master processot is described in figure 2. In the last one, any command that is
        shown indicates a transition to the sink state (the master model does not need this specification because
        any command not shown their is just illegal).

    \subsection{Testing the single processor}
        Combining those two models using 15
        states (each state has two versions - master and non-master, and another state to represent the sink state)
        we get a new Kripke model that represent all transitions a processor can use in its run.

        To make thinks easier we consider every processor to be in the shared state in the beggining, which
        means, as there must be one and only master, we have one state to consider as the initial state.
        At that point we started running the CTL and LTL model checkers on the next examples:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item
                liveness - at every state, it is possible for any model to get to a state where it owns the
                resource, and to a state where the resource is shared with him:
                
                $AG(EF(owned) && EF(shared))$

            \item
                safety - the sink state is unreachable:
                
                $AG(\lnot sink)$
            
            \item
                startvation - when a processor wants to own $K$, it would own eventually:
                
                $AG(owned\_waiting \Rightarrow AF(owned))$

                $AG(owned\_waiting \Rightarrow F(owned))$

        \end{itemize}

        Those three examples of formulas give us 3 CTL formulas and 2 LTL formulas. Table \ref{table:1} presents the basic results
        obtained from running both model checkers on those 5 examples. Both checkers simplified the formulas so the LTL checker only
        use the $U$ and $X$ quantifier, and the CTL checker only uses $EX$, $EU$ and $EG$.

        The main point to notice is that the formula complexity has almost no impact on the CTL model checker. On the other hand, as the
        formula gets complicated, its tableau grows and the size of the model the LTL model checker has to verify grows as well. That takes much
        more time, as expected.

    \subsection{Testing multiple processors}
        At that point, we wanted to test each of those formulas on a model of more then one processor.
        To generate a model that represent this protocol with more than one processor, we only need
        to $multiply$ two single processor models - that is the model whose the state set is the cartesian
        product of the original models, and a relation between two states exists \Leftrightarrow the corresponding
        relations exist in the original models.

        This is almost true, except we have to make sure the following:

        \begin{itemize}
            \item At all point there must be a single processor who is the master at that point.
            Using the BDD for "this state is a master state" we can restrict the new model to have
            a single master in every state.
            \item The existence of the relations in the original model is not enough for the relation
            in the product model to exist - they also need to have the same result for existing, which means
            they have to refer to the same command (the previous master sent the command, and every other 
            processor has received it). This is done by actual labeling the transitions with a specific BDD
            for each command. The BDD method guarantees that when the product model is created the labels would
            be taken into consideration, as needed.
        \end{itemize}

        The initial state would be, again any state for which every state is in the shared mode (but 
        only one is the master). Then, we can test each formula on the prespective of a single node
        (is it guaranteed that no node is ever starved, etc.)

        Figure 3 demonstartes how the size of the model (number of processors running) impacts on the the size of the
        problem (obviously) and thus takes much longer to solver using the simple CTL model cheker. The graph is drawn
        with log axis, as we expect the size of the model to increas exponentially with the number of processes in the model.
        Notice that the complexity of the formula does not impact the running duration of the CTL model checker.

    \subsection{Testing the LTL model checker}
        As described in Table 1, the LTL checking computation time is significally longer then the CTL checker. Unfortunately, it
        was so long we could not get any result for models with 3 processors or more. The root of the computation, the SCC finder algorithm,
        took many hours to iterate over the result product model. In this section we will show and briefly discuss the results
        for checking the models with single and two processors.

        The results shown here also compare between the LTL checker with and without simplying the LTL formulas so they only use the $X$ and $U$
        quantifiers. Specifically, the formulas we tested on were:

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Safety
            
            $(1)$ $AG(\lnot sink)$ as oppose to $(1*)$ $A(\lnot (true\ U\ \lnot(\lnot sink)))$

            \item Starvation 
            
            $(2)$ $AG(owned\_waiting \Rightarrow F(owned))$ 
            
            as oppose to 
            
            $(2*)$ $A(\lnot (true\ U\ \lnot(owned\_waiting \Rightarrow true\ U\ (owned))))$
        \end{itemize}

        On section 4.7 we described the actual change in the algorithm needed to compute the tableau for formulas containing the $G$ and $F$
        quantifiers. Considering the quivalences $Fa \equiv true\ U\ a$ and $Ga \equiv \lnot F \lnot a$, theoretically, one can change the appearance
        of each $XF$ and $XG$ elementary formulas with a $XU$ elemntary function, and every fairness constraint with the new kind of fairness constraint
        corresponding to the temporal quantifierts.

        The conversion could help though, mostly because it demands much less computation steps - for example, each computation of sat is completed a bit faster,
        and even the actual formula parsing could be faster (it is much easier to analyze a unary operator string). On figure 4 we show the size of BDD needed to
        present the product of the formula tableau and the model with $n$ processors. Table 2 shows the computation time needed to check the formulas with
        the model of 1 and 2 processors.

        Another point to notice is that the size of the model (and the size of the final product as a result) does not grow exonentially perfect. This is because
        the size of the model is exactly $|Single\ processor\ model|^n$, as after the product processing we lose most of the nodes, as there should be one and
        only master at each state consider in the multiple processors model.

        As mentioned above, it is clear the computation of the short versions is much faster, even though the size of the tableau stayed about the same (as expected).
        This mostly shows that the overhead of checking the model with the formula takes significant time of the actual computation. Additionally, The number of SCC
        in the product model stays exactly the same between the two versions of formulas. This is because, as established before, the tableau structure stays the same,
        even after using the extended form.

        \begin

\section{Further Work}

    We were surprised by that result - we expected the computation time to be about the same on the simplified. By our analysis this is caused mostly becuase the 
    model building procedure has a significant amount of overhead that is reduced when the formula is less complicated. We tried to reduce that overhead using profiling
    and improving the points of failure in our implementation, without any significant improvements. This is also iteresting because it raises the question how else can we 
    improve the computation so that the LTL model checking is faster. On the other hand, we have established (again) that the LTL model checking is exponential with the size of the model, and that would stay the same, no matter what we find.
