abstract="We show how LTL model checking can be reduced to CTL model checking with fairness constraints. Using this reduction, we also describe how to construct a symbolic LTL model checker that appears to be quite efficient in practice. In particular, we show how the SMV model checking system developed by McMillan [16] can be extended to permit LTL specifications. The results that we have obtained are quite surprising. For the specifications which can be expressed in both CTL and LTL, the LTL model checker required at most twice as much time and space as the CTL model checker. We also succeeded in verifying non-trivial LTL specifications. The amount of time and space that is required is quite reasonable. Based on the examples that we considered, it appears that efficient LTL model checking is possible when the specifications are not excessively complicated.",
